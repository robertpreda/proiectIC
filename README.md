## Overview
The goal of our project is to do face and facial landmarks detection, highlighting important points of the face in order offer support for emotion recognition for persons who are not able to do so naturally (Asperger's syndrome).
The classification algorithm can be run on either a photograph of a person, loaded into the GUI, or live on video.

For the GUI, we used the Python module called TKinter: https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html

For the Neural Network we used a detector using the dlib library.
 
The dataset which we trained the NN on is the iBUG 300-W dataset: https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/facial-point-annotations/
