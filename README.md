## Overview
The goal of our project is to classify the ethnicity of a person, in 4 different classes: Asian, Black, Latino and White.
The classification algorithm can be run on either a photograph of a person, loaded into the GUI, or live on video.

For the GUI, we used the Python module called TKinter. For the image classification algorithm, we used a deep learning module called Pytorch.
The deep neural network has been trained on the Chicago Faces Dataset (CFD): https://chicagofaces.org/default/
